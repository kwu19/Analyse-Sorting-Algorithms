# Analyse-Sorting-Algorithms

Using random number generation (as I have done in class) use timing analysis to compare Bubblesort, InsertionSort, Selectionsort, Shellsort, Mergesort, Quicksort.

This will require lists larger than 500 to get good timings. Adjust for your computer's capabilities. Provide meaningful plots of these results using Matplotlib.
